# many samples means we have an unrealistic amount of samples per client.
# this serves as a comparison for later real federeated learning.
# we have 462 speakers, with 10 samples each. a realistic federated use case would be one client only gets 10 of those samples.
# this many samples base line means we have only 2 clients with 231 speakers each.
# we have 10 rounds with 1 epoch. this mimics training on classical data for 10 epoch.
# 2 clients is the least minimal federated model we can make so this is a good entry point
